* Soria

Soria is a color theme which mixes:

- [[http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2140][xoria256]]: a color theme by Dmitry Zotikov, originally for Vim. I did not do
  the initial porting from Vim to Emacs, I took it from [[https://github.com/suxue/xoria256-emacs][suxue]].
- openSUSE: I took some colors from [[http://opensuse.github.io/branding-guidelines/][openSUSE's Brand Guidelines]].

In the =soria-theme.el= file I list further acknowledgements. To install it,
just drop the =soria-theme.el= file into your =~/.emacs.d= and load it with
=load-theme=.

** Configuration

This color theme defines the =soria= group, which in turn has only one
configuration option:

- =soria-hide-helm-header=: the Helm package in combination with Projectile
  shows a header that in my humble opinion is quite useless and it's
  distracting. For this reason, this header is hidden by default. If you set
  it to false, then you'll see the header with the same colors as the status
  line.

Moreover, this theme also provides one function that can be used as a hook:
=soria-purple-identifiers=. As a reminder, this color theme is a port from Vim,
and Vim and Emacs have some different takes on function identifiers. As such,
the original Vim theme defines identifiers as purple, but only method
definitions in Ruby, Perl and PHP (languages that I've used with these theme,
there might be more) were highlighted this way, but that wasn't the case for C,
C++ or Go. This is certainly a bug in Vim, but I got used to it, and when doing
this port I could notice this a lot. For this reason, by default this color
theme for Emacs defines function identifiers as white, but it provides this
function so in other languages can be drawn in purple.

** Screenshots

I've saved some screenshots in the =screenshots= directory. They do not show a
full sample of all the defined colors, but it will give you a good idea of the
look and feel of this theme. A glimpse:
