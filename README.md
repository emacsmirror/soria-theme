## Soria

Soria is a color theme which mixes:

- xoria256: a color theme by Dmitry Zotikov, originally for Vim (see
  [original](http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=2140)). I did not
  do the initial porting from Vim to Emacs, I took it from
  [suxue](https://github.com/suxue/xoria256-emacs).
- openSUSE: I took some colors from [openSUSE's Brand Guidelines](http://opensuse.github.io/branding-guidelines/).

In the `soria-theme.el` file I list further acknowledgements.

To install it, just drop the `soria-theme.el` file into your `~/.emacs.d` and
load it with `load-theme`.
